- End-to-end automation without manual intervention
- Reusable step definitions and modular Page Object Model for maintainability
- Demonstrates **professional-grade enterprise automation methodology**

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is part of an enterprise environment. The code cannot run outside One Window but demonstrates my automation skills.
